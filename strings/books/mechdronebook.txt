<BIG><B>The Mechdrone is a little helper drone that can be programed via packets!
<br>
<br>The pointers are small electronic devices that the drone can be instructed to go to.
<br>
<br>Using mechcomp, the packet format and commands ar these:
<br>
<br>address_1=x&command=y
<br>
<br>Some more complex commands will add the following:
<br>
<br>address_1=x&command=y&data=z
<br>
<br>Here are the commands of the mechdrone:
<br>
<br>command=load --> Picks the smallest object in it's spot from the ground and carries it.
<br>command=unload --> Unloads the carried object.
<br>command=say&data=(What you want it to say) --> Makes the drone say something
<br>command=follow --> Makes the drone go to the origin of the signal
<br>command=stop --> Makes the drone stop moving
<br>command=pointer&data=(pointer name) --> Makes the drone go to a specified pointer
<br>command=interact&data=(Object, machine, etc. that you want it to interact with) --> Makes the drone put the object it's carrying into the specified object if possible, or interact with that object. So it can for example, carry a potato and put it in a oven, or click a mechcomp button.
